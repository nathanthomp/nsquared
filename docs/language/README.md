### Integer
The Integer type has a size of 32 bit. This data type represents the set of Natural Numbers with a lower bound of -2,147,483,647 and an upper bound of 2,147,483,647.

### Float
The Float type has a size of 32 bits, 1 bit for the sign, 23 bits for the matissa, and 8 bits for the exponent. This data type represents the set of Real Numbers with a lower bound of 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000034 and an upper bound of 339,999,999,999,999,996,123,846,586,046,231,871,488.

### Boolean 
The Boolean type has a size of 1 bit. This data type represents propositional logic, where 1 is for true, and 0 for false.

### Character
The Character type has a size of 8 bits. This data type represents each of the character codes from the ASCII table.
